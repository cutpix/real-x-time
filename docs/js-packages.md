[This is a catalog](https://js.coach/>) of open 🇸ource JS 📦's.

Libraries come and go. The ecosystem evolves rapidly, and that's a good thing. But it means 
you can't rely on your bookmarks. Google may not be your best friend either, since it focuses 
on popular results — established solutions that may not be the best fit for your project.

This website indexes new packages and is updated roughly once per day, by using both automated
scripts and manual curation. It is a complete rewrite and grown-up version of React.parts, 
a tiny project that started a year ago. Even if you are implementing your own solution for your 
particular problem, this can be a good place to find interesting code to learn from.

Я надеюсь, что этот каталог будет являться таким же полезным для вас, как и для меня.
