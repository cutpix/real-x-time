**📦 This is a [catalog](https://js.coach/>) of open 🇸ource JS packages.**


> Libraries come and go. The ecosystem evolves rapidly, and that's a good thing. But it means 
you can't rely on your bookmarks. Google may not be your best friend either, since it focuses 
on popular results — established solutions that may not be the best fit for your project.

> This website indexes new packages and is updated roughly once per day, by using both automated
scripts and manual curation. It is a complete rewrite and grown-up version of React.parts, 
a tiny project that started a year ago. Even if you are implementing your own solution for your 
particular problem, this can be a good place to find interesting code to learn from.

🔥 **I hope this catalog is as useful to you as it is to me.**
