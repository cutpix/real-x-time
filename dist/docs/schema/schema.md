## [RDF Dataset Normalization](http://json-ld.github.io/normalization/spec/)

A Standard RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm

When data scientists discuss normalization, they do so in the context of achieving a particular set of goals. 
Since the same information may sometimes be expressed in a variety of different ways, it often becomes necessary 
to be able to transform each of these different ways into a single, standard format. With a standard format, 
the differences between two different sets of data can be easily determined, a cryptographically-strong hash 
identifier can be generated for a particular set of data, and a particular set of data may be digitally-signed 
for later verification.
